# Cleaning-Data
Cleaning Data Coursera Project  

The project is using the function run_analysis() in the run_analysis.R, to 
* Merge the relevant data set;
* Select and name the relevant variables;
* Compute the requested average on the relevant variables.

The R scipt run_analysis() has the following pre-requisite:

1. "the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" Dataset on the working directory.
2. installed on the R system the libraries dplyr and data.table.

The script visualise the final data set (using the View() function) 
and it writes it on the file "finale.txt" in the current working directory.
